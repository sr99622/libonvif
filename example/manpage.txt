NAME 

    onvif-util

SYNOPSIS

    onvif-util [-ah] [-u <user>] [-p <password>] [host_ip_address]

DESCRIPTION

    View and set parameters on onvif compatible IP cameras. The command may be used to find and identify cameras, and then to create an interactive session that can be used to query and set camera properties. 

    -a, --all
        show all cameras on the network

    -h, --help
        show the help for this command

    -u, --user 
        set the username for the camera login

    -p, --password
        set the password for the camera login

    To view all cameras on the network:
    onvif-util -a

    To login to a particular camera:
    onvif-util -u username -p password ip_address

    To login to a camera with safe mode disabled:
    onvif-util -s -u username -p password ip_address

    Once logged into the camera you can view data using the 'get' command followed by the data requested. The (n) indicates an optional profile index to apply the setting, otherwise the current profile is used

EXAMPLES

    A typical session would begin by finding the cameras on the network

    > onvif-util -a

      Looking for cameras on the network...
      Found 8 cameras
      192.168.1.18 localhost(TV TV-IP319PI)
      192.168.1.7 (IPC-BO IPC-122)
      192.168.1.14 IPC(Dahua IPC-HDW4631C-A)
      192.168.1.6 IPC(Amcrest IP2M-841EB)
      192.168.1.12 (AXIS M1065-LW)
      192.168.1.12 (AXIS M1065-LW)
      192.168.1.2 IPC(Amcrest IP3M-HX2W)
      192.168.1.11 R2(IPC-model)

    To start a session with a camera, use the login credentials

    > onvif-util -u admin -p admin123 192.168.1.12

      found host: 192.168.1.12
      successfully connected to host

SEE ALSO 

  There is a gui version of this program included with the libonvif package which will implement most of the same commands. It may be invoked using the 'onvif' command. The gui has the ability to view camera video output using a player such as ffplay, provided that the player executable is installed in the computer path.

NOTES

  Camera compliance with the onvif standard is often incomplete and in some cases incorrect. Success with the onvif-util may be limited in many cases. Cameras made by Hikvision will have the greatest level of compatibility with onvif-util. Cameras made by Dahua will have a close degree of compatability with some notable exceptions regarding gateway and DNS settings. Time settings may not be reliable in some cases. If the time is set without the zone flag, the time appearing in the camera feed will be synced to the computer time. If the time zone flag is used, the displayed time may be set to an offset from the computer time based on the timezone setting of the camera.

  If the camera DNS setting is properly onvif compliant, the IP address may be reliably set using onvif-util. Some cameras may not respond to the DNS setting requested by onvif-util due to non compliance. Note that the camera may reboot automatically under some conditions if the DNS setting is changed from off to on.

  Video settings are reliable. The Admin Password setting is reliable, as well as sync_time and the reboot command. If there is an issue with a particular setting, it is recommended to connect to the camera using the browser command, as most cameras will have a web interface that will allow you to make the changes reliably. The gui version has a button on the Admin tab that will launch the web browser with the camera ip address automatically.
