summary: GUI application for ONVIF compatible cameras
description: |
  A graphical interface for working with ONVIF compatible IP cameras. This application can discover cameras on
  the network, control camera parameters and display camera output. Multiple cameras can be viewed simuoltaneously
  in the display. Camera output can be recorded to disk archive. Cameras can be configured to use lower resolution
  streams during real time operation to conserve resources and to stream high resolution output to disk archive
  for maximum observability.
  
  The application is equipped with a built in yolox model for computer vision analysis of real time stream data
  to generate alarms and recordings. The application includes built in OpenVINO compute runtime drivers so that
  computers with Intel CPU can leverage iGPU compute power to increase the number of streams that can be analyzed.
